A third-person 3D playground and a mysterious zone known only as *Sausage Shadows*.

Crafted by James J Thompson. Guided by Patch.  
Built in Godot. Meaty on purpose.

## 🎮 About the Project

*The Chorizo Prophecy* is a exploration sandbox created to explore game development, 3D design, and GitHub workflows.  

The world begins with one character — **Mushnub** — exploring the sausage-scented secrets of a single open zone. No combat, looting, or typical RPG systems (yet). The focus is on movement, exploration, and eventually: meat-themed mysteries.
