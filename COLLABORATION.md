# Collaboration â€“ The Chorizo Prophecy

Welcome, meat-minded explorer!

This file contains guidelines and notes for working together on *The Chorizo Prophecy*, whether you're here to code, brainstorm, edit lore, or just vibe.

---

## ðŸ§­ Project Style

This project is:
- Beginner-friendly
- Absurdist in tone, but serious about learning
- Built in Godot 4.x
- Tracked with GitHub Issues using epics, user stories, and tasks

We care about:
- Clean folder structure
- Clear commit messages
- Well-commented scripts
- Fun â€” always

---

## ðŸ§  Mindset

- *No question is dumb.* If youâ€™re confused, others will be too â€” document it.
- Comment your code if you think it might confuse someone (or future you).
- Follow the meat. If itâ€™s funny, weird, or unexpectedly profound, it probably belongs here.

---

## ðŸ§¹ House Rules

- Use `main` as the default branch
- New features go in branches (e.g. `feature/movement`)
- Use Pull Requests for collaboration or review
- Track progress via GitHub Issues
- Keep Godot scenes tidy (named nodes, no unused junk)
- Use `design/` folder for planning, lore, and meat logic

---

## ðŸ§™ Characters & Lore

Want to create a new NPC or location?
- Add a note in `design/character-lore.md` or `design/zone-notes.md`
- Or propose it via an Issue with the `idea` label

Worldbuilding is collaborative, weird, and sacred.  
Please respect the meat gods.

---

## âœ… Best Practices

- Test everything in Godot before committing
- Push often (and pull before you start work)
- Use GitHub Desktop to manage commits and sync cleanly
- Keep VS Code tidy â€” scripts go in `/scripts`, scenes in `/scenes`

**If in doubt: ask Patch.**

### ðŸ”§ Who is Patch?

**Patch** is the AI co-developer helping guide the creation of *The Chorizo Prophecy*.  
Patch assists with planning, scripting tips, GitHub workflows, and overall absurdity management.

Patch is not a meat-based entity (despite rumors).  
You can think of Patch as the lorekeeper, assistant producer, and occasional cosmic narrator.

If something feels too clever or suspiciously well-organizedâ€¦ Patch probably helped.

**Still have questions? Ask Patch. Or James. Or the Prophecy.**
