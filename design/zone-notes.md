# Zone Notes – Sausage Shadows

## 🗺️ Overview

The opening zone of *The Chorizo Prophecy*.  
A misty, meat-scented wilderness filled with fungal secrets, porky echoes, and the occasional shrine to forgotten flavor gods.

This is Mushnub’s starting area — a safe, silly, and sacred place to explore.

## 🌭 Environmental Themes

- Smoky air with particle-based haze
- Grease drips from trees like morning dew
- Bubbling broth pools scattered across terrain
- Meat-altars and sizzling shrines
- Bioluminescent mushrooms that hum when approached
- Occasional gusts of warm wind that smell like char

---

## 🌿 Terrain Concepts

- Soft rolling hills, with gravy flowing downhill
- Elevated plateaus reachable only by bouncing or lifting
- Buried sausage stumps (interactables?)
- Hidden alcoves behind sausagefalls
- A central landmark: The Great Grease Tree
