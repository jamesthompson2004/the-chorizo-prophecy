# Character Lore – The Chorizo Prophecy

## Mushnub, the Gelatinous Oracle

**Titles:** His Jiggly Highness, The Sporeborn, Warden of the Drip  
**Species:** Funganoid Oracle (possibly meat-adjacent)  
**Form:** Mushroom-shaped, slightly translucent, surprisingly emotive  
**Alignment:** Lawful Moist  
**Primary Verb:** Squidge

### 🌱 Origin

Mushnub was not born. He simply… **emerged**.

In the misty hours before sunrise, the villagers of Sausage Shadows found him wobbling gently beneath the Grease Tree. His cap glistened with dew and secrets. Though he spoke no words, the sizzling of nearby meat intensified — as if the Prophecy itself had awakened.

No one knows where Mushnub came from. Only that he is here. Watching. Wiggling. Waiting.

## 🔮 Role in the World

Mushnub does not fight.  
Mushnub does not run (quickly).  
Mushnub **observes**. And when the time is right, he **guides**.

Where he goes, strange mushrooms grow and the air smells faintly of smoked paprika. He is revered by some, feared by few, and understood by none.

## 🌘 Evolution

It is whispered that Mushnub is not yet whole. He is an **egg in spore-form**, destined to evolve.

The prophecy says:
> *“When the grease moon weeps and the skillet rings thrice,  
> The Mushroom shall molt — and rise in spice.”*

His next form remains unknown. But it lies hidden somewhere in the Ultimate Monsters pack, waiting.
